      This getting started tutorial will teach you the very basics on how to get
      going with A-Frame from making a simple cube to animations and then bringing
      it all together with a game.<br>

      You can type in the box below.<br>
      When you make a change you can press the <code>execute</code> button and
      <b>see the result on the right</b>.<br>
      Let's get something on the screen, <b>copy and paste</b> this code into the box.<br><br>
      <code class="example">&#60;a-box position="0 0 -3" rotation="45 45 0" color="purple"&#62;&#60;/a-box&#62;</code><br>
      Don't forget to hit the execute button!

  - subtitle: Viewing the result
    instruction: >-
      When you've made something interesting you can see it in the right hand side box
      and you can <b>click and drag</b> on it to pan around.<br>
      While this is useful for debugging, it isn't really VR. That's why we've created
      a way to <b>view it on a phone</b> or other webVR compatable device.<br>
      See those characters in the <b>bottom right</b>? Open your device and go to
      <code><a href="/preview" target="_blank">http://<span class="replaceWithHost"></span>/preview</code></a>
      and type in those characters.<br>

      Now you should see your code on the device.
